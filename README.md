# Conditional saving 4.529040672e-5 from paid whole-chain clones

## Reproducing the pinned PR 54 baseline

This integration checkout is pinned at
chafreaky/integer-mult-bounds@7210de7d0f9ccaeb64c3f60f188419e02be08d95.
Run python3 scripts/replay_pr54_baseline.py to capture the focused
make skip-clones-verify replay, including its command, runtime, exit status,
environment, and source hashes. Add --full to run the broader make verify
afterward. Logs and a machine-readable receipt go under
build/pr54-baseline/. The manual GitHub Actions workflow file is included in
this branch; GitHub makes it dispatchable after it is present on the default
branch. See the [integration map](docs/research/pr54-integration-map.md) for
the source lineage and compatibility boundaries.

The [clone proof and reproduction note](research/skip-clones/PROOF.md) gives
**κ = 141532521/3125000000000 = 4.529040672e-5 > 2^-15**, conditional on
OpenAI's base theorem and the inherited analytic and fixed-tape interfaces.
This is **0.686876% above PR 53** and **17.769260% above PR 36**.

Starting from Avi Eisenberg's PR #53 skip-prefix graphs, 606 explicitly paid
whole-chain clones retain the original core/cover envelopes. The actual
weighted matchings yield R23=32693, R25=43056 and W=159592676. Every added
operation is included in the exact profiles, and both complete dirty-basis
orientations are replayed. The I+J geometry, all data pairs, copied centers,
paid endpoint corrections and complex layer are inherited unchanged.
The source-partition/whole-chain cloning construction is adapted from
RaD / hipotures (PR 51); this original-envelope specialization and exact
integration are by Chafik Boukhalfa with OpenAI Codex assistance.

Run `make skip-clones-verify`; `make verify` retains the predecessor checks.
There is no claim of global optimality or an unconditional multiplication theorem.

# Conditional saving 4.498144e-5 from skip-prefix strips

The [proof and reproduction note](research/skip-strips/PROOF.md) gives
**κ = 4498144/10^11 > 2^-15**, conditional on OpenAI's base theorem and
retained analytic and fixed-tape interfaces. This is **9.2146906%** above
PR #48 (411862541/10^13), on which it is built, and **16.9658501%** above
PR #36. For comparison, PR #49's later claim of 4.123863984e-5 is 9.0759544%
below this value.

Only the scalar producer changes. Every vertex's leave-one-out strip sums use
the skip-prefix layout s_j = A_{j-2} + (v_{j-1} + B_{j+1}) instead of
s_j = A_{j-1} + B_{j+1}. The two consumers of every prefix, and of every new
suffix-side node, then have nested envelopes. The inherited carrier matching
can therefore continue a retained carrier instead of allocating a fresh role.

Carrier links rise from 6,002/7,715 to 12,719/16,991 at h=23/25 under PR #44's
pinned weighted matching. Roles fall from 36,432/48,329 to 32,946/43,409. The
physical wire count falls from **177,530,859** to **160,799,739**. Exact bounds
show the PR #40–#48 networks fail at the new bit saving 4498347/10^11, while
this network passes.

Run `make skip-strips-verify` to rerun the full scalar, label, pinned-matching
replay, fixed-profile, dirty-basis timeline, exhaustive data-pair, exact
recovery and exact-fraction checks, plus 20 adversarial tests. `make verify`
includes this target. Finite certification is not formal verification or
external acceptance of the full theorem; no global optimality or measured
speedup is claimed. The PR #48 result follows.

# Conditional saving 4.11862541e-5 from reordered exclusion sums

The [proof and reproduction note](research/copied-fixed/PROOF.md) gives
**κ = 411862541/10000000000000 > 2^-15**, conditional on OpenAI's base theorem
and retained analytic and fixed-tape interfaces. This is **7.0971766%**
above PR #36 and **0.4388585%** above our previous PR #46.

Reorder the prefix/suffix construction of leave-one-out sums, restore their
original output indices, and recompute the weighted carrier matching.
The changed graphs retain 403 more carriers across the two local networks,
reducing the physical wire count by **847,550** to **177,530,859**.
Exact bounds show #46's network fails at the new bit saving while this
network passes. Complete scalar, fixed-profile and dirty-basis replay
checks the changed construction. All paid copies and data blocks remain.

Run `make copied-fixed-verify` for full scalar, label, matching, fixed-profile,
physical timeline, exhaustive data-pair and exact-fraction checks.
`make verify` includes these and the inherited suite. The proof, exact
search scores, source credits and limitations are included. Finite
certification is not formal verification or external acceptance of the
full theorem; no global optimality or measured speedup is claimed.
The original PR #36 result follows for comparison.

# Integer multiplication with conditional saving 3.84569e-5

$$
T(n)=O\!\left(n(\log n)^{1-\kappa}\right),\qquad
\kappa=\frac{384569}{10000000000}=3.84569\times10^{-5}.
$$

Copied retained-center reads replace each local rank pair `(r,h)` by
`(r,h-r)`, including the transformed copy. In the adopted two-stage topology,
this reduces the total rank from `Wm-N+2L` to `Wm-N+L`.

The selected bit construction uses dimensions `(25,23)` and the certified
data profile `11 singletons; 21,15,481`. The complex construction uses
`(28,28)` with mixed-center parameter `d=19`. Their strict savings are
`384599/10000000000` and `717/10000000`, respectively. Semantic assembly
uses `C1=1` and product row stock `p^2000`; the final absorption gap
exceeds `4.0746e-11`.

The result remains conditional on the retained multiplication framework,
the attributed analytic and tape interfaces, and their eventual thresholds.
Finite checks support the written proofs; they do not constitute a formal
verification or a complete multiplication implementation.

## Proof and reproduction

- [Current proof source](notes/copied-centers-note.tex).
- [Exact certificate](certificates/copied-centers-network.json): complete
  child lists, moments, semantic precision and 47 strict constraints.
- [Incremental producer and corner checks](scripts/copied_centers_producer.py).
- [Adopted two-stage and corner proofs](references/copied-centers/README.md),
  [analytic dependencies](references/semantic-bulk/README.md),
  [reproduction instructions](docs/reproducibility.md) and [provenance](SOURCES.json).

```sh
make copied-centers-verify
```

This target checks the new mixed-center producer and exact corner witness,
reuses the unchanged verified bit producers, and certifies the new assembly.
`make verify` additionally runs inherited checks. Proofs are supplied as
LaTeX source; no new PDF is included.
